# Dynamic-Weather-Forecast-Visualisation
Utilised a Rest API to get the forecast weather data of New Delhi for the next 14 days using Python. Automated the python code output with Power BI to display a Dynamic chart which refreshes with the new data.


Got the API for free (trial 14 days) from the weatherapi.com


Only selected temperature and conditions of the place for the visulaisation but one can chose numerous other parameters including wind directions, moon conditions, etc.
